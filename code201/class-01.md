# Introduction:
All websites use HTML and CSS, Understanding HTML and CSS and Java Script can help anyone who works with the web; designers can create more attractive and usable sites, website editors can create better content, marketers can communicate with their audience more effectively, and managers can commission better sites and get the best out of their teams.

##### HTML is used to create web pages. You then add tags or elements like text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, video audio and flash, and miscellaneous elements.

### How People Access the Web?
Different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology:
>**Browsers**  People access websites using software called a web browser. Like Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera
>**Web Servers** When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website
>**Screen readers** are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.
>**Devices** People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

# Chapter 8: Extra Markup:
## Q: Why we did use DOCTYPE?
A: Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using. In HTML5 use 
<!DOCTYPE html>

## Q: How we Can Write a Comment in HTML?
A: If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
 < <!-- --> >
< --This Code 201 Class  -->

## Q: Why did we use ID Attribute?
A: It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.

## Q: what is the difference between Block Elements and in line Elements?
A: Block Elements: elements appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level   elements. like :<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.
In line Elements : appear to continue on the same line as their neighboring elements like :<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.

## Q : Mention Grouping Text &Elements In a Block and inline block and describe it ?

A: The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
 <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

# Chapter 18 :Process & Design
This Chapter discusses a process that you can use when you are creating a new website.

Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore 

very important understand who your target audience is. and understand who your visitors are, most will visit for a specific reason.

Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.


# Part2 : Java Script
## A-B-C Programming
### A
What is a script and how do I create one?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
• RECIPES
• HANDBOOKS
• MANUALS
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
a script is just a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem in hand
### B
How do computers fit in with the world around them?
### C
How do I write a script for a web page?
To achieve the goal Follow smaller steps: 
1.DEFINE THE GOAL 
First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
3. CODE EACH STEP
Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
