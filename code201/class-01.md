Introduction:
All websites use HTML and CSS, Understanding HTML and CSS and Java Script can help anyone who works with the web; designers can create more attractive and usable sites, website editors can create better content, marketers can communicate with their audience more effectively, and managers can commission better sites and get the best out of their teams.

HTML is used to create web pages. You then add tags or elements like text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, video audio and flash, and miscellaneous elements.

How People Access the Web?
Different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology:
•	Browsers  People access websites using software called a web browser. Like Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera
•	Web Servers When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website
•	Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.
•	Devices People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
