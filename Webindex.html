            <p style="background-color:lightsteelblue ;">It's been said that a garden is never really done—and that's totally true! There's always space for one more plant.
                Gardens continue to evolve through the years as you discover and fall<br> 
                in love with new plants—that's what makes gardening so fun and challenging. To make your garden shine in every season,
                plant both annuals and perennials, which come back year after year, as well<br>  
                as bulbs and shrubs. And believe it or not, there are even plants that bloom in winter! Adding a
                variety of different kinds of annuals, perennials, and shrubs with different<br> 
                 bloom times also provides habitat and food for pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies. 
                Seeing these little beauties visit is part of the joy of gardening!</p>
