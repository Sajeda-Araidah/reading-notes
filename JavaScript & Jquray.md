# A-B-C Programming
## A  
What is a script and how do I create one?
### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
* RECIPES
* HANDBOOKS
* MANUALS

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.a script is just a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem in hand

### B 
How do computers fit in with  the world around them? 
### C 
 How do I write a script for a web page?

 ### To achiev the goal Follow  smaller steps:
 ## 1. DEFINE THE GOAL
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.

## 2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.


## 3. CODE EACH STEP
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

# RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES
## JavaScript has only a few rules for variable names:

* The first character must be a letter or an underscore (_). You can't use a number as the first character.

* The rest of the variable name can include any letter, any number, or the underscore. You can't use any other characters, including spaces, symbols, and punctuation marks.

* variable names are case sensitive.

* There's no limit to the length of the variable name.

* You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name.

* Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.

## ARRAYS :
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

## EXPRESSIONS :
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.
